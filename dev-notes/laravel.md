When developing a Laravel project, I usually organize everything under the `app/` directory. The exact structure depends on the tools I plan to use—whether it’s just pure Laravel, Filament, or a combination of both. I adapt the structure to fit the tools and features I need, keeping things clean and modular.

### Features Directory
When adding a feature in Laravel, I organize it inside the `Features` directory. I follow a modular approach for scalability and maintainability. Each directory inside `Features` is self-contained, making management easier. If certain logic is shared across multiple features, I include a `Shared` directory within `Features` to hold that reusable code.

- **Feature Folder**
  - Each feature has its own folder under `Features/FeatureName/`.
  - Everything related to that feature (models, controllers, actions, services, policies, tests, views, routes, providers) stays inside its folder.

- **Models**
  - Represent the database tables for that feature.
  - Keep business logic out of models—use Actions or Services instead.

- **Controllers**
  - Keep them thin: just handle requests and call Actions.
  - Don’t put business logic here.

- **Actions**
  - All the main business logic lives here.
  - Each Action does one specific job (like `CreateFeature` or `UpdateFeature`).

- **Services**
  - Hold reusable code that doesn’t fit in Actions or Models.
  - Shouldn’t depend on Controllers.

- **Policies**
  - Handle authorization (who can do what) for this feature.
  - Keep them focused on the feature itself.

- **Tests**
  - Put tests in `Tests/` inside the feature folder.
  - Final classes, extend the base test case, use traits like database refresh.
  - Only mock external services or irreversible actions.

- **Views**
  - Blade templates for this feature.
  - Use subfolders if there are lots of views.

- **Routes**
  - Each feature has its own `Routes/web.php`.
  - Name routes like `feature.action` (e.g., `feature.create`).
  - Don’t add feature routes to the global route files.

- **Providers**
  - Feature-specific service providers (for services, observers, events, etc.).

- **Shared**
  - `Features/Shared` is for code used by multiple features (traits, helpers, utilities).
  - Don’t put feature-specific stuff here.
  
### Filament Directory
For systems focused on data and analytics and information management, I usually use Filament. Sometimes, if two user types share almost the same features, I create a single panel for both and use RBAC for security. But if the user types have very different features, I make separate panels to keep things clean and secure.

- **Resources**
  - Each resource represents a model (like `UserResource` for the User model).
  - They handle only Filament-specific stuff: forms, tables, filters, and actions.
  - Keep business logic out—put that in Actions or Services in `Features`.
  - Use policies for authorization; don’t manually check permissions in the resource.
  - **Inside each resource**, you can have:
    - `Pages/` → resource-specific pages like Create, Edit, or List.
    - `Relations/` → manage relationships with other models.
    - `Widgets/` → resource-specific widgets for dashboards or stats.
    - `Forms/` → schemas that define the forms for this resource.
    - `Tables/` → schemas that define the tables for this resource.

- **Pages**
  - Custom admin pages like `Dashboard` or `Settings`.
  - Use Livewire components for interactivity, but keep them small and focused.

- **Widgets**
  - Dashboard or stats widgets, or any reusable UI block.
  - Build small, focused widgets and combine them as needed.
  - Cache expensive queries, like stats overview, to keep things fast.

- **Hooks**
  - Renderhooks are used to customize Filament elements and are typically place in the `FilamentPanelProvider/`. I use this directory to keep the `FilamentPanelProvider/` clean and thin.
  - These are used to customize Filament elements (like navigation, forms, tables, or dashboards).

- **Clusters**
  - Logical groups of related resources, pages, and widgets (like `UserManagement` or `ContentManagement`) to keep things organized.
  - Clusters also help organize navigation and permissions in the admin panel.

- **Providers**
  - Service providers for the app and Filament panels.
  - Global providers like `AppServiceProvider`, `AuthServiceProvider`, `EventServiceProvider`.
  - Filament-specific panel providers like `AdminPanelProvider` and `UserPanelProvider` handle panel setup, menus, and security.

### Database Directory
During development, if you forget to add a field in a migration—or if AI assistance misses it—don’t create a new migration just to add that field, and definitely don’t run `migrate:fresh`.  

Instead, **edit the original migration** to include the missing field and then use `php artisan tinker` (or update the database directly) to apply it. This approach keeps things clean during development.  

⚠️ Note: This is **only for the development phase**. Never do this in production—always create proper migrations for changes there.
