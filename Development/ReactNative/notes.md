<h1 align="center"> React Native </h1>

React Native is a framework for building mobile applications with React. It allows you to use a single codebase for both Android and iOS, making it a popular choice for cross-platform mobile development.

```

To start building React Native applications, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio). If you're building for iOS, you'll also need [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) on macOS. For most projects, it's recommended to use [Expo](https://expo.dev/) since it makes setup and development much easier.

Once everything is installed, make sure the `node`, `npm`, and `npx` commands work in your terminal before creating a new project.
